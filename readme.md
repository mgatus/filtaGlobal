Just wanted to say thank you for the assessment opportunity. I appreciate it!. 

Exercise 1
---
Build a responsive page based on the designs.

##### Libraries
1. Vuejs
2. TailwindCSS

##### Assets
I've made some aesthetics changes by replacing the banners with actual photos. Additionally, 
instead of utilizing the Bootstrap framework, I opted to recreate the page using Tailwind CSS as part of my ongoing study on its implementation.

Exercise 2
---
Please use a live server (via visual studio code plugin or other server) to view the page and data correctly

###### Bonus points
* Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`.

The result is "banana" because the expression involves concatenating strings and attempting to convert a non-numeric string ('a') to a number. 
The addition operation with the unary plus (+) results in NaN (Not a Number), but the concatenation continues, and the final string is converted 
to lowercase with .toLowerCase().
